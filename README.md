# Repo for my blog and portfolio deployed on [Netlify](https://dauwbot.netlify.app/)

Project is using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) project. You can read the process used to create this at [my blog](https://dauwbot.netlify.app/thoughts/).

I'm partial to the fact that content is the main interest of a website. Design should come second to it, typography, spacing and color usage should be the major development focus. Especially when not wanting to sell somebody a product.
