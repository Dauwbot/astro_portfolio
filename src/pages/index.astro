            <p>
                This will someday be my portfolio website. It uses <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> as a framework. If you are here because I'm looking for a job: you can <a href="https://github.com/Dauwbot/astro_portfolio/tree/develop">read the source-code of this website on Github</a>. It's deployed with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web is getting more intricate by the day and <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">going back</a> to <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">simpler times</a> is something <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">we could all benefit</a> from, like in our everyday lives!
                <br>It's mainly used to gather my <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a> for now, hopefully I'll add some more work on this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm trying to keep it as clean as possible. I'm not here to sell anything to you. I just want to discuss subjects that are interesting when you're a starting developer.
                <br>I chose Astro because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted a static website for SEO. Who knows maybe this will be a hit! (lol)</li>
                <li>I feel like side projects should be fun and not related to work: I've been using React & Angular at work for quite some time and I wanted to come back to an ecosystem where I can write big fat HTML files without worrying about the latest trend</li>
                <li>I wanted to learn multiple frameworks and amazingly <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> can run
                    <a href="https://astro-docs-preview.vercel.app/core-concepts/component-hydration">components</a> from all the big guys out here!</li>
                <li>Honestly I feel like, even in the current beta state, Astro is easier to understand than most of the big-shots!</li>
            </ul>
